# snorkel
This repo groups in a single place every new concept I find interesting enough
to implement.

It is all very experimental, and you should not expect a production-ready
general use library. That being said, feel free to take a look and help me out,
I hope I am not commiting any grotesque error, but as they say, two heads think
better than one. Your help will be much apreciated! :)

## Arenas
Arenas were the starting point of snorkel, it was very fun to implement and so
rewarding! Never again I am going back to the malloc/free nightmare...

My implementation is still very concise, but it is slowly growing as my needs
also grow.

## strings
Well, since I was already here, there's no harm in packing the length with the
char\*. Also included some helper functions, but didn't really go too far on
this one.

## coroutines
It's in C, I swear!!!!

I never really understood the application of coroutines, until I started making
my [chip8 emulator](https://github.com/garipew/cemu8) and decided to play
around with asynchronous IO operations. And then, all the potential struck me,
so, as any normal person would, I decided to give it a try and implement it!   

Not really done yet, well, nothing here is. 

## Notes
I intend to let this repo grow as time passes, slowly. That's all for now!
